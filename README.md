# IOT-Blockchain
A IOT Sensor data/temperature control for a crypto mine (building inside a building)- on blockchain - because hey, why not.

This is a system designed for a building (room) within a building.

The aim of the project is to satisfy the following:


1.The noise needs to be contained by the room. Absolutely! I can't stand noise. (ASIC's = Noise++).
2.

Problem: I have an ASIC mining room built inside a building (Shop) Diagram 1.1, where the noise needs to be contained by the room, and the temerature of the mining cold isle, hot isle, and temperature of the shop each need to be monitored and controlled. Also, the various room pressures need to be maintained according to ideal pressures.

Solution: By using multiple variable speed fans, temperature sensors, dampers,and controllers, establish a code suitable for Arduino to control the system to maintain shop at 70 Degrees, while having the cold isle within acceptable parameters.
